# vet-clinic-database

## Project Description
Welcome to the Vet-Clinic-Database, an information store for pet animals, which tracks data such as pet-weight, nutered-state, date-of-birth and animal birth. 

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
